        <p>While each deck has its own energy and purpose, combining them can create a powerful synergy that provides multi-layered guidance and insight for your spiritual journey.</p>
        <p>Tarot cards follow a structured system with Major and Minor Arcana, offering detailed insights into situations and energies. Oracle cards, on the other hand, are more fluid and often focus on specific themes or messages.</p>
        <h3>Complementary Approaches</h3>
        <p>When combined thoughtfully, tarot can provide the structural framework of a reading while oracle cards can add nuance, clarification, or spiritual guidance. This integration allows for a reading that addresses both practical concerns and spiritual dimensions.</p>

        <p>Discover how our ancestors harnessed lunar energy for healing and transformation, and how you can incorporate these timeless practices into your modern wellness routine.</p>
        <p>For thousands of years, cultures around the world have synchronized their spiritual practices with the phases of the moon. These ancient rituals weren't just superstition â€“ they were practical ways to align human activities with natural cycles.</p>
        <h3>New Moon Intentions</h3>
        <p>The new moon represents beginnings and potential. Create a ritual where you write down intentions or goals you wish to manifest in the coming lunar cycle. Place these in a special container or altar space to revisit throughout the month.</p>
        <h3>Full Moon Release</h3>
        <p>The full moon is perfect for releasing what no longer serves you. Write down habits, thoughts, or situations you want to let go of, then safely burn the paper while visualizing these energies transforming into light.</p>
